# How to create a multiball with a virtual ball lock


If your machine does not have a physical ball lock you can use a counter
to count how many times a ball has been "locked". This could be a ball
device (as in the example) or any normal shot.

This is an example:

``` yaml
switches:
  s_middle_ramp:
    number:
coils:
  c_plunger:
    number:
ball_devices:
  bd_middle_ramp_ball_lock:
    eject_coil: c_plunger
    ball_switches: s_middle_ramp
##! mode: mb_mode
multiballs:
  3balls_multiball:
    ball_count: 3
    ball_count_type: total
    shoot_again: 30s
    start_events: logicblock_mb_counter_complete
counters:
  mb_counter:
    count_events: balldevice_bd_middle_ramp_ball_lock_ball_entered
    count_complete_value: 3
##! test
#! start_game
#! start_mode mb_mode
#! hit_switch s_middle_ramp
#! advance_time_and_run 15
#! hit_switch s_middle_ramp
#! advance_time_and_run 15
#! hit_switch s_middle_ramp
#! advance_time_and_run 15
#! assert_balls_in_play 3
```
