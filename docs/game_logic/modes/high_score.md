# High score (mode)


MPF includes a built-in high score mode that can be used to track high
scores, including letting players enter their names (or initials) and
tracking different high score awards. (See the How To: High Scores guide
for details).

You can use the config files to completely customize how the high scores
work, including the number of scores to track, what you call each award
("GRAND CHAMPION", "HIGH SCORE 1", etc.) and what (and how many)
awards you track (score, loops, aliens blasted, etc.).

The high score mode stores its high scores in
`<your_machine_folder>/data/high_scores.yaml` file. It automatically
reads them in when MPF boots to create machine variables that can be
accessed from your game, and it automatically updates the high scores on
disk when they change after a game ends.

See [High Scores](../high_scores/index.md) for details.
See [High Score Events](../../events/high_score/index.md) for events from the built-in mode.
