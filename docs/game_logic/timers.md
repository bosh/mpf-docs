# Timers


Related Config File Sections:

* [timers:](../config/timers.md)

MPF config files include the concept of "timers" which you can use to
count towards a specific event based on time. Timers can be configured
to count up or down, at whatever interval you want, at any speed you
want. You can use events to start, stop, pause, reset, or change their
speed.

Timers post events with each "tick" which you can use to update the
display, play sounds, etc. They also post events when they complete
which you can use to stop a mode, play a show, etc.

Example uses of timers might include:

* Hurry up count down to make a shot (with variable score based on how
    much time is left).
* Timer to end a timed mode.
* A timer which ticks periodically to rotate a lit shot left or right.
* Etc.

The example config files section of the documentation contains
[examples of timers in modes](../examples/index.md).

## Displaying the value of a timer on a slide

If you want to use your timer in a slide you have to set the value to a
player variable first:

``` yaml
##! mode: your_mode
# in your mode
timers:
  your_timer:
    start_value: 0
    end_value: 20
    control_events:
      - action: start
        event: mode_your_mode_started
variable_player:
  timer_your_timer_tick:
    your_timer_variable_times_100:
      int: device.timers.your_timer.ticks * 100
      action: set
slides:
  show_timer:
    widgets:
      - type: Text
        text: (player|your_timer_variable_times_100)
slide_player:
  mode_your_mode_started: show_timer
##! test
#! start_game
#! start_mode your_mode
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_text_on_top_slide 0
#! advance_time_and_run 1
#! assert_text_on_top_slide 100
```

In this example we update the player variable `timer_your_timer_tick`
every time the timer changes based on the tick event. The value is
multiplied by 100 (but you can also omit this or do anything
[Variable player](../config_players/variable_player.md)
supports). Afterwards, you can use the variable in your slide.

## Displaying the value of a timer on a slide in minutes and seconds

In this example, we'll display a count-down timer as minutes and seconds. Again, if you want to use your timer in a slide you have to set the value to a
player variable first:

``` yaml
##! mode: your_mode
# in your mode
timers:
  your_timer:
    start_value: 180
    end_value: 0
    control_events:
      - action: start
        event: mode_your_mode_started

variable_player:
  timer_your_timer_tick:
    your_timer_minutes:
      int: device.timers.your_timer.ticks / 60
      action: set
    your_timer_seconds:
      int: device.timers.your_timer.ticks % 60
      action: set

slides:
  show_timer:
    widgets:
    - type: text
      text: 'Time Left: (player|your_timer_minutes)'
      font_size: 72
      anchor_x: left
      anchor_y: bottom
      x: 100
      y: 906
      z: 2
    - type: text
      text: ':'
      font_size: 72
      anchor_x: left
      anchor_y: bottom
      x: 350
      y: 906
      z: 2
    - type: text
      text: '(player|your_timer_seconds)'
      min_digits: 2
      font_size: 72
      anchor_x: left
      anchor_y: bottom
      x: 365
      y: 906
      z: 2

slide_player:
  mode_your_mode_started: show_timer
##! test
#! start_game
#! start_mode your_mode
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_text_on_top_slide 0
#! advance_time_and_run 1
#! assert_text_on_top_slide 100
```

In this example we update the player variable `timer_your_timer_tick` every time the timer changes based on the tick event. The value is divided by 60 to calculate the number of whole minutes remaining and stored as the variable `your_timer_minutes`. We also calculate any ticks above the whole number of minutes into seconds with the `int: device.timers.your_timer.ticks % 60` line and store this as `your_timer_seconds`. We then display these in our slide with a text widget of `:` placed between the two values.
