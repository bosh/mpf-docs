# High Scores in EM Machines

Electro Mechanical (EM) pinball machines usually do not have a display
which allows a player to enter initials. To use the existing
[high score mode](../../index.md) we can preset
player initials using [player_vars:](../../config/player_vars.md).

``` yaml
player_vars:
  initials:
    value_type: str
    initial_value: AAA
```

After setting this in your machine config the high score mode will no
longer ask for initials. The exact string (here `AAA`) does not matter
since you usually will not show it anyway. If you have another way to
enter initials you can also use that and set the initials to the
`initials` player variable.
