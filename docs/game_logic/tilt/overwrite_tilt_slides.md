# Overwriting Tilt Slides

!!! note "This guide is intended for MPF versions before 0.80"

    MPF 0.80 creates slides via Godot, not in the YAML game config files like MPF 0.57.
    The updated guide for creating custom tilt slides and overwriting default tilt mode
    slide behaviors lives [in the GMC guides section](../../gmc/guides/tilt_mode.md).

The [tilt mode](../../index.md) comes with very
basic slides. You can overwrite them using the following config:

``` yaml
#! switches:
#!   s_tilt:
#!     number:
#!     tags: tilt_warning
##! mode: tilt
# in your modes/config/tilt.yaml
slides:
  _overwrite: true   # this is important to overwrite the existing slides
  tilt_warning_1:
    widgets:
      - type: text
        text: "STOP IT"
    expire: 1s
  tilt_warning_2:
    widgets:
      - type: text
        text: WARNING
        y: top-2
        anchor_y: top
      - type: text
        text: "SERIOUSLY STOP IT"
        y: top-18
        anchor_y: top
        expire: 1s
    expire: 2s
  tilt:
    - type: text
      text: TILT
##! test
#! start_game
#! post slam_tilt
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_mode_running tilt
#! hit_and_release_switch s_tilt
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_text_on_top_slide "STOP IT"
#! advance_time_and_run 2
#! assert_text_not_on_top_slide "STOP IT"
#! hit_and_release_switch s_tilt
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_text_on_top_slide "SERIOUSLY STOP IT"
```

By setting the `_overwrite: true` you will overwrite the complete
`slides:` section of the built-in tilt mode. The slides above are the
default slides.

!!! note

    You can add a slide for the `slam_tilt` event. However, by default the
    `tilt` slide is also shown at the same time so you have to make sure
    that your slide has a higher priority than that slide.
