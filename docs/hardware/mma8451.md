* [accelerometers:](../config/accelerometers.md)

This chips can be connected to I2C and act a tilt and leveler. Available
on
[adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mma8451-accelerometer-breakout/overview)
(and elsewhere).

Configure using:

``` mpf-config
hardware:
  accelerometers: mma8451
accelerometers:
  my_accelerometer:
    level_x: 0
    level_y: 0
    level_z: 1
    number: 1-29
```

This will configure an MMA8451 on I2C bus 1 with address 0x1D (29
decimal which is the default for this device). The exact numbering
depends on your i2c platform.

The device in the picture is using
[smbus on linux](smbus.md)
as i2c platform with an Atiny85-based I2C-USB adapter.
