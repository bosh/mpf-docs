This guide explains how to connect a PIN2DMD RGB LED DMD to a pinball
machine running MPF.

[PIN2DMD](https://pin2dmd.com/) is a RGB DMD display which connects to a
PC via USB. It exists in a 128x32 (traditional pinball) and 192x64 pixel
(large SEGA/Data East displays) version.

MPF supports several different types of RGB DMDs, and the PIN2DMD is
just one of the options. More information about this type of display and
other options that MPF supports is available in the
[Using an RGB full-color LED DMD](../../mc/displays/rgb_dmd.md) documentation.

This is how a 128x32 pixel PIN2DMD looks in action:

And this is how a 192x64 pixel PIN2DMD looks:

## 1. Buy and Assemble your PIN2DMD

To use PIN2DMD in MPF you should first install your panel as described
on the [PIN2DMD homepage](https://pin2dmd.com/) (steps hardware and
firmware).

## 2. Install pyusb

MPF uses libusb via pyusb to drive your PIN2DMD. To use your PIN2DMD you
need to install pyusb using pip:

``` console
pip3 install pyusb
```

## 3. Configure your PIN2DMD hardware settings

Once you have your hardware all set, you need to add a `smartmatrix:`
section to your machine-wide config and which tells MPF how to talk to
RGB DMDs that use the SmartMatrix platform.

1.  Add `pin2dmd` to your hardware section:

``` yaml
hardware:
  rgb_dmd: pin2dmd
pin2dmd:
   # debug: True           # uncomment this if you experience any issues and need debug output
  resolution: 128x32       # or 192x64 depending on your panel
  panel: rgb               # or rbg if colors are swapped
```

## 3. Add a physical RGB DMD device entry

Once you have your SmartMatrix hardware platform set, you need to create
the actual device entry for the RGB DMD and map it back to the
SmartMatrix platform.

You do this in the `rgb_dmds:` section of the machine config. This
section is like the other common sections (switches, coils, etc.) where
you enter the name(s) of your device(s), and then under each one, you
enter its settings.

(And yes, in case you're wondering, it's possible to have more than
one physical DMD.)

To do this, create a section in your machine-wide config called
`rgb_dmds:`, and then pick a name for the DMD, like this:

``` yaml
rgb_dmds:
  default:  # your DMD
    hardware_brightness: .5      # adjust the brightness of your display if it is too bright
    fps: 30
```

There are several settings you can enter here. (See the
[rgb_dmds:](../../config/rgb_dmds.md) for details.). For
PIN2DMD the display currently has to be named `default` because there
can be only one PIN2DMD connected.

You'll probably also want to configure the brightness, which is a
multiplier from 0.0 to 1.0 that's applied to every pixel that's sent
to the DMD. In other words, the example of `hardware_brightness: .2`
means that each pixel will be shown at 20% brightness. (These things are
crazy bright!)

## 4. Set a source display

Now that you have everything configured, the last step is to make sure
the DMD knows what content to show. In MPF, you do this by mapping a
physical DMD to an
[MPF display](../../mc/displays/index.md).

``` yaml
displays:
  window:  # on screen window - useful for debugging without real hardware
    width: 600
    height: 200
  dmd:  # source display for the DMD
    width: 128      # 192 if you got a 192x64 pin2dmd panel
    height: 32      # 64 if you got a 192x64 pin2dmd panel
    round_anchor_x: left
    default: true
```

By default, the DMD will look for a display (in your
[displays:](../../config/displays.md) section called "dmd".
However you can override this and configure the DMD to use whatever
logical display you want by setting a `source_display:` setting. (Just
make sure that the width and height of your source display match the
physical pixel dimensions of the DMD or else it will be weird.)

## A final config you can test

At this point you're all set, and whatever slides and widgets are shown
on the DMD's source display in MPF-MC should be shown on the physical
RGB DMD.

That said, all these options can be kind of confusing, so we created a
quick example config you can use to make sure you have yours set right.
(You can actually just save this config to `config.yaml` in a blank
machine folder and run it to see it in action which will verify that
you've got everything working properly.)

To run this sample config, you can either run `mpf both`.

When you run it, do not use the `-x` or `-X` options, because either of
those will tell MPF to not use physical hardware which means it won't
try to connect to the Teensy.

Note that the [Using an RGB full-color LED DMD](../../mc/displays/rgb_dmd.md)
guide has more details on the window and slide settings used in this
machine config.

  rgb_dmd: pin2dmd

  # debug: True           # uncomment this if you experience any issues and need debug output
  resolution: 128x32      # or 192x64 depending on your panel
  panel: rgb              # or rbg if colors are swapped
displays:
  window:  # on screen window
    width: 600
    height: 200
  dmd:  # source display for the DMD
    width: 128      # 192 if you got a 192x64 pin2dmd panel
    height: 32      # 64 if you got a 192x64 pin2dmd panel
    default: true
    round_anchor_x: left
window:
  width: 600
