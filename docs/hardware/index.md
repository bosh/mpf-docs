# Working with physical hardware

This section will discuss working with Pinball control systems and electronics,
as well as working with physical pinball mechs and devices.

MPF controls a pinball machine by interfacing to a modern pinball
control system. (See the [platform](../start/index.md)
for details.) MPF itself is hardware-independent, meaning that MPF (and
the configs and code you build) runs on a
[normal/embedded PC](computer.md) and
can work with lots of different kinds of control systems and hardware
devices.

Not only does this give you a choice of what type of pinball control
hardware you want to use, it also means that you have the flexibility to
change your hardware at any time without having to change any game code.
You could even release a game code update that works on multiple
platforms---all with the same code!

Here's a demo video of us switching out a P-ROC controller for a FAST
controller in 3 minutes and running the same game code on both:

</div>

It's possible to mix-and-match multiple types of hardware in a single
MPF machine config. For example, you could combine the SmartMatrix RGB
DMD with a FAST Core controller, or a FadeCandy LED controller with a
P-ROC, etc. (You can even mix-and-match platforms within the same type
of device, meaning you could have some LEDs attached to a FAST Pinball
controller and others attached to a FadeCandy. See the
[Mixing-and-Matching hardware platforms](platform.md) guide for details.)

MPF currently supports the following hardware control systems. We are
always adding more, so if there's a hardware device that you'd like to
use that we don't support, let us know. (Or better yet, write your own
interface to it and submit a pull request to the MPF codebase!)

Also see our guide on
[voltages found in a pinball machine](voltages_and_power/index.md).

## List of pinball control systems & hardware compatible with MPF

Here's a list of all the different types of control systems and
hardware that MPF currently supports. If there's a type of hardware
you'd like us to support that you don't see on this list, you can add it!
(Or, you can get the hardware maker to add it.)
Reach out in the [forum](../community/index.md) if you need help.

!!! note "Pinball hardware makers are responsible for their own MPF integration"

    The maintainers of MPF are responsible for maintaining the MPF
    software itself. But the individual "platform" code that allows
    MPF to interact with physical hardware is owned and maintained
    by the hardware vendors themselves. (e.g. FAST Pinball maintains
    the [`/platforms/fast`](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/tree/dev/mpf/platforms/fast)
    code, CobraPin and the OPP project creators maintain the
    [`/platforms/opp`](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/tree/dev/mpf/platforms/opp)
    code, etc.)

    If you have a specific feature, support, or documentation
    request for how MPF interacts with pinball hardware, reach out to
    that company.
