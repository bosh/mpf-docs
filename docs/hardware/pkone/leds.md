# How to configure WS281XLEDs (Penny K Pinball)


Related Config File Sections:

* [pkone:](../../config/pkone.md)

Each PKONE Lightshow add-on board has a built-in 8-group RGB or RGBW LED
controller (depending upon which firmware is loaded on the Lightshow)
which can drive up to 64 RGB or RGBW LEDs per group (a total of up to
512 LEDs). This controller uses serially-controlled LEDs (where each LED
element has a little serial protocol decoder chip in it), allowing you
to drive dozens of LEDs from a single data wire. These LEDs are
generally known as "WS2812" (or similar). You can buy them from many
different companies, and they're what's sold as the "NeoPixel" brand
of products from Adafruit. (They have all different shapes and sizes.)

Most of the settings in the [Lights](../../mechs/lights/index.md) documentation apply to LEDs connected to PKONE Lightshow
boards, however there are a few PKONE-specific things to know.

## Channel and Number Syntax

--8<-- "light_channels_numbers.md"

PKONE assumes RGB or RGBW lights by default (depending upon which
firmware your Lightshow board is running). For everything else (i.e.
RGBW) you have to use channels.

The PKONE Lightshow supports 512 LEDs on eight groups (64 in each
group).

### Light Numbers

The `number:` setting for each LED is its board's Address ID number in
the PKONE chain, a dash, the LED output group number (1-8), another
dash, then finally the LED output number in the group chain (1-64)
(`address id`-`group`-`number`). Internally, PKONE assumes three
channels per LED (RGB/GRB) when running RGB firmware and four channels
per LED (RGBW) when running RGBW firmware. While assigning numbers
manually will work, it is recommended you use the newer chaining syntax
referenced below in the Channels section.

### Channels

PKONE channels use the format: `address id`-`group`-`index`

`address id` and `group` are the same as above and `index` is a an index
from 0 to 191 for RGB firmware and 0 to 255 for RGBW firmware. The
channel syntax makes it easy to mix LEDs of various types in the same
group chain (as long as they are WS281X compatible). The easiest, and
recommended, method of numbering is to chain the LEDs in your
configuration file and have MPF calculate the internal channel numbers
for you (please note the `type` setting is required when using
`start_channel`/`previous` settings):

``` mpf-config
lights:
  led_0:
    start_channel: 0-1-0
    subtype: led
    type: rgb    # will use red: 0-1-0, green: 0-1-1, blue: 0-1-2
  led_1:
    previous: led_0
    subtype: led
    type: rgbw   # will use red: 0-1-3, green: 0-1-4, blue: 0-1-5, white: 0-1-6
  led_2:
    previous: led_1
    subtype: led
    type: rgbw   # will use red: 0-1-7, green: 0-1-8, blue: 0-1-9, white: 0-1-10
```

This method of chaining your LEDs works exactly the same way whether
your Lightshow board is running RGB or RGBW firmware.

See [WS2811 and WS2812 LEDs in Pinball](../../mechs/lights/ws2812.md) for additional
details.

## Color Correction

If you are using RGB LEDs, they might not be perfectly white when you
turn them on. They might be pinkish or blueish instead depending on the
brand of the LED. To a certain extend this is normal/expected and you
can compensate for it by configuring
[color_correction profiles in light_settings](../../config/light_settings.md).

## subtype:

Single value, type: `string`. Defaults to empty.

This value is used to distinguish between simple LEDs and WS281X RGB
LEDs in the PKONE hardware system. This value must be set to `led` or
left empty when setting up WS281X RGB/RGBW LEDs.
