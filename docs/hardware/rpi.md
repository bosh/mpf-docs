# Raspberry PI (pigpio)


Related Config File Sections:

* [servos:](../config/servos.md)

The rpi platform can be used to control inputs (switches), outputs
(coils), I2C and servos on the RPi remotely (or locally) using pigpio.

## Installation

You need to install the `apigpio` extension via pip to use it:

``` console
pip3 install apigpio_mpf
```

The [pigpiod](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpiod.html) service needs
to be running (in this example on localhost port 8888, which is the
default setting). To install it and enable is (on debian based systems):

``` console
apt install pigpiod
systemctl enable pigpiod.service
systemctl start pigpiod.service
```

The [enable](#) step gets the service running at startup, thus
it is optional.

## Using pigpio via network

If you want to use your RPi over ethernet you have to edit
`/lib/systemd/system/pigpiod.service` and change
`ExecStart=/usr/bin/pigpiod -l` to `ExecStart=/usr/bin/pigpiod`. This is
not needed if you run MPF on the RPi itself. Make sure your Raspberry PI
is not accessible from the internet and the network is segmented
properly.

## Config

This is an example config:

``` mpf-config
hardware:
  platform: rpi
raspberry_pi:
  ip: localhost
  port: 8888
switches:
  s_switch_8:
    number: 8
  s_switch_7:
    number: 7
coils:
  output_2:
    number: 2
    default_pulse_ms: 1000
servos:
  servo_26:
    number: 26
```

Configure the ip of your RaspberryPi in the `raspberry_pi` section. You
may use localhost if you are running MPF on the RPi. Any pin on the RPi
can be used as either input or output. Additionally, you may use servos
on any pin.

## Available GPIOs

You check GPIO locations on your RPi at
[pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/). Please note that you have to use the
Broadcom GPIO numbers instead of the pin numbers. Those slightly differ
between different RPi models. If you get permission errors in your MPF
log this is usually because you used a GPIO number which does not exist
on your hardware.

## Is this a real pinball controller?

No. The RPi is not a pinball controller for various reasons:

* Drivers are missing to drive coils
* Inputs are unprotected and any error current will fry the CPU
* Hardware rules are not supported by the `pigpio` daemon
* A watchdog is missing

This platform is meant as a cheap interface for peripherals such as
DMDs, segment displays lights, servos, steppers and more. You can also
use it for inputs to some extend.

## Can this be turned into a pinball controller?

Sure it can. We just did not do that here. Have a look at
[Arduino Pinball Controller](apc/index.md) which is kind of
that already.

If you want to do it with pigpio you would have to do the following (and
probably more):

* Build a PCB with FETs to drive outputs. Add proper protection.
* Protect your inputs against high and negative voltages.
* Implement hardware rules in `pigpio` (might be possible with
    callbacks)
* Run a realtime linux for proper timing of your rules
* Add a some watchdog (either in Linux or in hardware)

## What if it did not work?

Have a look at our [hardware troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting_hardware/index.md).
