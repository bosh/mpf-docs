# MPF Versions


MPF is a work-in-progress. New versions are released every so often. You
can find your MPF version by running `mpf --version` from
the command line.

**The current long-term-support (LTS) version of MPF is 0.57**

**The next-generation version of MPF is 0.80**

If you're looking for a specific version of the documentation to match
the older version of MPF you're using, look in the "Assets" link at
the bottom of the release notes for any version in the [MPF releases
page on GitHub](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/releases).
