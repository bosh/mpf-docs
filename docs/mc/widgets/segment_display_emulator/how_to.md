# How to setup and use the virtual segment display emulator


This guide explains the basic steps to setup the virtual segment display
emulator for your machine. Support for the visual component of the
virtual segment display emulator is part of the MPF media controller and
only available if you're using MPF-MC for your media controller.

## 1. Add your main display to your MPF config

Add the segment display to your list of displays in your machine-wide
config file:

``` yaml
displays:
  window:
    width: 600
    height: 200
##! test
#! post show_slide_event
#! advance_time_and_run .1
```

The example above contains a single display named "window" and has a
size of 600x200. This will be the display that shows up on the computer
screen.

## 2. Add your window configuration

The `window:` section of the machine-wide config holds the settings for
the on-screen display window. If you don't have this section, add it
now.

You can make the width and height anything you want. In this case we're
just configuring it to be 600x200 with a window title of "Mission
Pinball Framework".

``` yaml
window:
  width: 600
  height: 200
  title: Mission Pinball Framework
##! test
#! post show_slide_event
#! advance_time_and_run .1
```

## 3. Configure a window slide to show the on screen segment display

Now we have a working on-screen window, but if you run `mpf both` now,
your on screen window will be blank because we haven't built any slides
to show up.

So in this step, we're going to build a slide for the on-screen window
that will be shown when MPF starts. We'll add some widgets to that
slide to make it look like a segment display.

First, create a `slides:` section in your machine config (if you don't
have one already), and then create an entry for the slide that we want
to show. In this case, we've decided to name that slide
"window_slide_1". (Of course you can call this slide whatever you
want.)

``` yaml
slides:
  window_slide_1:
##! test
#! post show_slide_event
#! advance_time_and_run .1
```

Next we have to add some widgets to that slide. (Refer to the
[documentation on widgets](../index.md) if you're not familiar with widgets yet.)

The first widget will be a
[segment display emulator widget](index.md) with a
[glow effect](../display/effects.md) which is a widget which renders a emulation of a segment
display:

``` yaml
#! displays:
#!   window:
#!     width: 600
#!     height: 200
slides:
  window_slide_1:
    widgets:
      - type: segment_display_emulator
        name: display1
        character_count: 7
        character_slant_angle: 0
        character_spacing: 20
        segment_width: 0.11
        segment_interval: 0.04
        segment_off_color: 4b4c4a30
        segment_on_color: fe961bff
        side_bevel_enabled: true
        dot_enabled: true
        comma_enabled: true
        text: HELLO
        width: 600
        height: 150
        y: 100

#! slide_player:
#!   show_slide_event:
#!     window_slide_1:
#!       target: window
##! test
#! post show_slide_event
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_slide_on_top window_slide_1 window
```

As you can see there are a lot of configuration options to modify the
rendering of the segment display segments/characters. This leads to a
lot of very different looks for the resulting characters. One important
item to note is the name parameter of the segment display emulator must
match the name of the hardware segment display in MPF that we wish to
connect to.

## 4. Configure the slide to show when MPF starts

Now we have a nice slide with the virtual segment display on it, but if
you run MPF, you still won't see it because we didn't tell MPF to show
that slide in the window. So that's what we're doing here:

``` yaml
#! displays:
#!   window:
#!     width: 600
#!     height: 200
#! slides:
#!   window_slide_1:
#!     widgets:
#!       - type: segment_display_emulator
#!         name: display1
#!         character_count: 7
#!         character_slant_angle: 0
#!         character_spacing: 20
#!         segment_width: 0.11
#!         segment_interval: 0.04
#!         segment_off_color: 4b4c4a30
#!         segment_on_color: fe961bff
#!         side_bevel_enabled: true
#!         dot_enabled: true
#!         comma_enabled: true
#!         text: HELLO
#!         width: 600
#!         height: 150
#!         y: 100
slide_player:
  init_done:
    window_slide_1:
      target: window
##! test
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_slide_on_top window_slide_1 window
```

If you don't have a slide_player: entry in your machine-wide config, go
ahead and add it now. Then create an entry for the
[init_done](../../../events/init_done.md) event. This is the
event that the media controller posts when it's ready to be used, so
it's a good event for our use case.

Then under that event, create an entry to show the slide you just
created in the previous step.

## 5. Configure your virtual segment display "hardware"

At this point you have a simple display configured, and you have default
content showing up (the text "HELLO"). The final step is to add the
configuration for your virtual segment display "hardware" so that MPF
can control your segment display emulator as if it were a hardware
display.

MPF contains a virtual hardware platform to allow it to run without
physical hardware connected ([Using MPF without physical hardware](../../../hardware/virtual/index.md)). This virtual platform contains code to allow it to
communicate with segment display emulator widgets as if it were a real
hardware display (in fact, you can develop your game using the virtual
segment display and easily migrate it to actual hardware later with few
configuration changes).

The first step is to create a
[segment_displays:](../../../config/segment_displays.md) entry in your
machine wide config and add an entry for each segment display emulator
widget (in this example we created a single widget so we will only need
one entry).

``` yaml
segment_displays:
  display1:
    number: 1
```

A couple of things to note in the above configuration. `display1` is the
name we are assigning to the segment display. This parameter value must
match the one we assigned to the`name` parameter of the
segment_display_emulator widget when it was created on the slide
previously (we used a value of `display1`). Be sure these values match
or the communications between MPF and MPF-MC will not update the segment
display widget properly.

Repeat this process for each segment display emulator widget you
configure.

Now we need to let MPF know to send changes to the segment displays to
the virtual segment display emulator in MPF-MC. This is accomplished
using the [virtual_segment_display_connector:](../../../config/virtual_segment_display_connector.md) plugin.

``` yaml
virtual_segment_display_connector:
  segment_displays: display1
```

The `segment_displays` parameter contains a list of all the segment
display names you want to use in the connector to communicate with the
segment display emulator widgets in MPF-MC.

## 6. Update your virtual segment display using the segment_display_player

Now that the virtual segment display is configured in the hardware
section, it is time to configure the mechanism to update the text in the
display. To do this, we use the
[Segment Display player](../../../config_players/segment_display_player.md)
(see also [segment_display_player:](../../../config/segment_display_player.md)).

``` yaml
segment_display_player:
  update_segment_display_hello:
    display1:
      text: "HELLO"
  update_segment_display_red:
    display1:
      action: set_color
      color: "FF0000"
  update_segment_display_score:
    display1:
      text: "{players[0].score:d}"
```

The segment display player establishes segment display updates that are
triggered by events. In the above example, the
`update_segment_display_hello` event sets the segment display text for
display1 to `HELLO`. The `update_segment_display_red` event sets the
segment display color to red for display1. Finally, the
`update_segment_display_score` event sets the text to the score for
player 1 (this will update automatically as the score changes using
[Text Templates](../../../config/instructions/text_templates.md)).

Your virtual segment display should now be fully functional and ready
for you to customize further for your specific project.
