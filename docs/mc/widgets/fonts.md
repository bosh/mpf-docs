# Working with Fonts


You can specify which font you want to use as a property of any of the
widgets that contain text. You can use system-wide fonts that are
installed on the computer running MPF as well as fonts that are in your
machine's `/fonts` folder.

You specify fonts by name only (not including the extension), and MPF
will first look in your machine's fonts folder, and if it doesn't find
the font there, it will look in the MPF-MC's built-in fonts folder, and
finally in your machine's system fonts location.

!!! note

    The MPC MC contains a few pixel-based for use on DMDs. See
    [bitmap_fonts](dmd_fonts.md) for details.

For consistency of appearance across computers, we highly recommend that
you put the fonts you want to use in your machine's fonts folder.

Specifying which font a particular widget uses is done via that
widget's `font_name:` setting, so see either the
[bitmap_fonts](text/index.md) or
[bitmap_fonts](text_input.md) reference for details.

Keep in mind that all widget properties, including fonts, can be
configured as part of a widget style and easily applied to new widgets
with a single line.

MPF also supports [Bitmap Fonts](bitmap_fonts.md) if you
want to create your own fonts for your machine.

## How to Set Fonts and Sizes Globally?

You usually want to use three to five different font + size combinations
in your machine. However, you often want to adjust them later on without
touching all your slides and widgets. For that reason it makes sense to
define a [widget_style](styles.md) for all
your fonts and sizes:

``` yaml
widget_styles:
  text_small:
    font_size: 15
    color: red
  text_default:
    font_size: 21
    color: blue
```

You can then use `style: text_default` in your text widgets. See
[widget_style](styles.md) for details.
