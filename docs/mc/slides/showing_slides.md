# How to Show a Slide on a Display


Once you have your [slides created](creating_slides.md), you need to decide which slides you show when. (Just
remember you can test slides and widgets interactively using
[Interactive MC (iMC)](../../tools/imc.md).)

## Using the slide_player

The most common option is to use the
[creating_slides](../../config/slide_player.md) section of a config
file. This can be in either your machine-wide or in mode-specific config
files. (Like all mode settings, slides in a mode-based config file will
only play when that mode is active.)

The slide player is based on MPF's
[events system](../../events/index.md), meaning
that you basically say, "play THIS slide when THAT event happens".

For example, if you want to play a slide named "good_job" when the
event "left_lane_hit" is posted, you would set your config like this:

``` yaml
#! slides:
#!   good_job:
#!     - type: text
#!       text: "GOOD JOB"
slide_player:
  left_lane_hit: good_job
##! test
#! post left_lane_hit
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_text_on_top_slide "GOOD JOB"
```

You can have as many event/slide combinations as you want, like this:

``` yaml
#! slides:
#!   good_job:
#!     - type: text
#!       text: "GOOD JOB"
#!   ramp_champ:
#!     - type: text
#!       text: "RAMP CHAMP"
slide_player:
  left_lane_hit: good_job
  right_lane_hit: good_job
  left_ramp_hit: ramp_champ
##! test
#! post left_lane_hit
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_text_on_top_slide "GOOD JOB"
```

The above examples are what we call the "express" config option since
each event specifies a slide name, but no other options. (It just uses
the default options for showing each slide. But instead of putting the
slide name after the event name, you can also create a sub-entry with
the slide name, then *another* sub-entry with additional options, like
this:

``` yaml
#! displays:
#!   dmd:
#!     width: 128
#!     height: 32
#! slides:
#!   ramp_hit_slide:
#!     - type: text
#!       text: Ramp has been hit
slide_player:
  right_ramp_hit:
    ramp_hit_slide:
      expire: 2s
      target: dmd
##! test
#! post right_ramp_hit
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_text_on_top_slide "Ramp has been hit" dmd
```

You can mix-and-match all of these in a single config, like this:

``` yaml
#! displays:
#!   dmd:
#!     width: 128
#!     height: 32
#! slides:
#!   ramp_hit_slide:
#!     - type: text
#!       text: Ramp has been hit
#!   good_job:
#!     - type: text
#!       text: "GOOD JOB"
#!   ramp_champ:
#!     - type: text
#!       text: "RAMP CHAMP"
slide_player:
  left_lane_hit: good_job
  right_lane_hit: good_job
  left_ramp_hit: ramp_champ
  right_ramp_hit:
    ramp_hit_slide:
      expire: 2s
      target: dmd
##! test
#! post right_ramp_hit
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_text_on_top_slide "Ramp has been hit" dmd
#! advance_time_and_run 3
#! assert_text_not_on_top_slide "Ramp has been hit" dmd
```

In the example above, when the event "left_ramp_hit" happens, the
slide "ramp_champ" is shown. When the event "right_ramp_hit"
happens, the slide "ramp_hit_slide" is shown, but with the additional
options of setting the slide to expire (to be removed) after 2 seconds,
and for that slide to show on the "dmd" display target instead of the
default display.

There are many options for the slide_player in addition to the
"expire" and "target" options shown above. Refer to the
[creating_slides](../../config/slide_player.md) section of the
config file reference for full details.

## Adding slides to a show

The slide_player is one of MPF's many
[creating_slides](../../config_players/index.md) (so called because
they use a "config" section to "play" things). Config players can be
used in a config file (as shown above) and also in a show step. To use
the slide player in a show, you add a [creating_slides](../../config/slides.md) section to a show step.

For example, if you want a slide called "happy_face" to play in a step
in a show, you can do it like this (this is a snippet of a single step
in a show):

``` yaml
#! slides:
#!   happy_face:
#!     - type: text
#!       text: "Happy Face"
#! show_player:
#!   play_show: my_show
##! show: my_show
- duration: 3s
  slides: happy_face
##! test
#! post play_show
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_text_on_top_slide "Happy Face"
```

Again, you can use the sub-entry format to specify additional options:

``` yaml
#! displays:
#!   playfield_screen:
#!     width: 200
#!     height: 300
#! slides:
#!   happy_face:
#!     - type: text
#!       text: "Happy Face"
#! show_player:
#!   play_show: my_show
##! show: my_show
- duration: 3s
  slides:
    happy_face:
      target: playfield_screen
##! test
#! post play_show
#! advance_time_and_run .1
#! assert_text_on_top_slide "Happy Face"
```

## Creating new slides in the slide_player

Both of the options we've show so far (using the
[creating_slides](../../config/slide_player.md) section of a config
file and using the [creating_slides](../../config/slides.md)
section of a show) have used existing named slides that you would have
already defined in the [creating_slides](../../config/slides.md)
section of a config. You also have the option to define new slides
directly in each of these sections. See the
[How to create slides](creating_slides.md) section of the
documentation for instructions on how to do that.
