# Ducking


*Ducking* is an audio effect that lowers the level of one audio signal
based upon the level of another audio signal (one sound "ducks" out of
the way of another). It is used to allow particular sounds to be heard
more clearly when there is other audio playing at the same time. In the
context of a pinball machine, a common use of ducking is to lower the
volume of the background music while an important callout is played
(such as "Extra Ball!") and then return the volume when the callout is
finished. When done professionally, you should not really be able to
notice that the music volume is being lowered, but you'll be able to
hear the callout prominently.

By default ducking is not enabled for any sounds in MPF. Ducking
settings can be optionally set for each sound asset in the machine. To
best illustrate ducking and its parameters, here is a diagram:

The voice clip in the top track of the diagram illustrates a callout
that we wish to add ducking settings to. The bottom track is playing
music. The following parameters control the ducking behavior of the
voice clip:

* `target` - The track name to apply the ducking to when the sound is
    played. In the example above the `music` track is the
    target.
* `delay` - The duration to delay after the sound starts playing
    before ducking starts. This value may be specified as a time string
    or a number of samples.
* `attack` - The duration of the period over which the ducking starts
    until it reaches its maximum attenuation (attack stage). This value
    may be specified as a time string or a number of samples.
* `attenuation` - The attenuation (gain) to apply to the target track
    while ducking. This controls how quiet to make the target track
    while the sound is playing.
* `release_point` - The point relative to the end of the sound at
    which to start the returning the attenuation back to normal (release
    stage). This value may be specified as a time string or a number of
    samples. A value of 0.5 seconds means to begin to release the
    ducking 0.5 seconds prior to the end of the sound.
* `release` - The duration of the period over which the ducking goes
    from its maximum attenuation until the ducking ends (release stage).
    This value may be specified as a time string or a number of samples.

Ducking settings are specified for each desired sound in the
[sounds:](../../config/sounds.md) section of the
configuration files. It often takes some trial and error to get the
ducking parameters set just right for each sound.
