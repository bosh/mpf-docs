# Pinball Mechanisms


MPF supports all the various pinball hardware mechanisms you'd expect.
Some of these are basic (switches, LEDs, coils), and others are built up
by combining multiple simpler mechs (Switch X plus Coil Y = Flipper 1,
etc.)

Pinball mechs are mostly configured in machine-wide config files. Each
one has a name, and there are configuration options for each which
control exactly how it behaves (or how its behavior changes depending on
what's going on in your game).

Pinball Mechs in MPF include (but are not limited to):

* [Accelerometers](accelerometers.md)
* [Autofire Coils](autofire_coils.md)
* [Ball Devices](ball_devices/index.md)
* [Coils (Solenoids)](coils/index.md)
* [Diverters](diverters/index.md)
* [Flippers](flippers/index.md)
* [Kickback Lanes](kickbacks.md)
* [Lights](lights/index.md)
* [Loops / Orbits / Ramps](loops.md)
* [Magnets](magnets/index.md)
* [Motors](motors.md)
* [Playfields](playfields/index.md)
* [Plungers / Launch Devices](plungers/index.md)
* [Pop Bumpers](pop_bumpers/index.md)
* [Score Reels](score_reels.md)
* [Scoops / Vertical Up Kickers (VUKs) / Saucer holes](scoops.md)
* [Servos](servos/index.md)
* [Shakers](shaker.md)
* [Slingshot](slingshots.md)
* [Spinners](spinners.md)
