You can use a servo as a diverter by tying it into a diverter using
events. Specifically, we are using
[diverter_(name)_deactivating](../../events/diverter_diverter_deactivating.md)
and [diverter_(name)_activating](../../events/diverter_diverter_activating.md). This is an example:

``` yaml
#! switches:
#!   s_ball1:
#!     number:
#!   s_ball2:
#!     number:
#! coils:
#!   c_eject1:
#!     number:
#!   c_eject2:
#!     number:
#! ball_devices:
#!   bd_trough:
#!     eject_coil: c_eject1
#!     ball_switches: s_ball1
#!   bd_target:
#!     eject_coil: c_eject2
#!     ball_switches: s_ball2
diverters:
  d_diverter:
    debug: true
    feeder_devices: bd_trough
    targets_when_active: playfield
    targets_when_inactive: bd_target
servos:
  s_diverter:
    number:
    positions:
      0.7: diverter_d_diverter_activating
      0.2: diverter_d_diverter_deactivating
```

This diverter will not wait for the servo to reach the position. If you
need that let us know in the forum.
