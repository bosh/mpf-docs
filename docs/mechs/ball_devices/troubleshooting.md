# Troubleshooting Ball Device Issues


If you got problems in general we first recommend to read our
[troubleshooting guide](../../troubleshooting/index.md). Here we go into details for ball devices (troughs,
plungers, lock devices and more) in particular.

## Add debug

First, add a `debug: true` entry into your trough config in the
`ball_devices:` section. Then when you run with verbose logging (`-v`),
you'll get extra debugging information in the log.

## Received unexpected ball

You might get a line in your log telling your that the device received
an unexpected ball. This is usually not an issue. It means that the
device did not expect the ball. For instance, if a ball drains into a
trough or jumps into the shooter that is unexpected for the device. In
most cases you will see this message when a ball drained.

So what are expected balls? In modern machines the trough ejects a ball
into the shooter lane in which case the shooter lane device expects the
ball from the trough. This is connected to ball tracking and retry
behavior of devices.

## Ball Count Does Not Match

If your log file shows a number of balls contained in your trough that
doesn't match how many balls you actually have, that could be:

* You didn't add all the ball switches to the *ball_switches:*
    section of the trough configuration
* You're using a physical machine but a switch isn't adjusted
    properly so the ball is not actually activating it. (Seriously, we
    can't tell you how many times that's happened! We've also found
    that on some machines, if you only have one ball in the trough that
    the single ball isn't heavy enough to roll over the top of the
    eject coil shaft. In that case we just add a few more balls to the
    machine and it seems to take care of it.) Either way, if you have a
    ball in the trough, the switch entry in your log should show that
    the switch is active (*State:1*), like this:

``` console
2014-10-27 20:05:29,891 : SwitchController : <<<<< switch: trough1, State:1 >>>>>
```

If you see State:1 immediately followed by another entry with State:0,
that means the ball isn't activating the switch even though it might be
in the trough.

## Add debugging to related devices

If you got problems with some switches also add `debug: true` to those
as it will give to more insights into the intentions of those devices.
Same will work for flippers, coils, lights, servos, steppers and more.
See
[general debugging section](../../troubleshooting/general_debugging.md) for details.

## Run MPF with verbose flag

See
[general debugging section](../../troubleshooting/general_debugging.md) for details. TLDR: run `mpf both -t -v -V`.

## Report Your Issue and Ask For Help

If you cannot find the issue yourself please prepare some information
about your issue according to our
[troubleshooting guide](../../troubleshooting/index.md) and ask in our forum.

## Consider Improving the Documentation

Did you solve your issue but found that some relevant information in the
documentation is missing or should be linked/located elsewhere? Either
tell us in the forum or consider
[improving the documentation](../../about/help_docs.md) yourself to save future users some troubles the same way
others saved you some troubles by writing this documentation.
