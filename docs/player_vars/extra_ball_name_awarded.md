# extra_ball\_(name)\_awarded


--8<-- "player_var.md"

The number of times this extra ball has been awarded to the player in
this game. Note that the default max is one (meaning that each extra
ball can be awarded once per game), so this value will only be 0 or 1
unless you change the max setting for this extra ball.
