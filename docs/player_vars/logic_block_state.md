# (logic_block)\_state:

--8<-- "player_var.md"

A dictionary that stores the internal state of the logic block with the
name (logic_block). In other words, a logic block called
*mode1_hit_counter* will store its state in a player variable called
`mode1_hit_counter_state`.

The state that is stored in this variable includes whether the logic
block is enabled and whether it is complete.
