# Config Players


An important concept to using the YAML-based configuration files is
something we call *config players*.

*Config players* in MPF have nothing to with the actual human players of
your machine, rather, they are things that "play" based on
configurations.

Config players are used in both the machine-wide and mode-specific
config files, and also in show steps.

* In a config file, the config players are setup via the
    `(config_player_name)_player:` section of the file.
* In show steps, config players are accessed via the
    `(config_player_name)s:` setting.

Some examples:

* You play sounds via a config file in the `sound_player:` section,
    and you play sounds from a show step via the `sounds:` setting for
    that step.
* You show slides on a display via a config file in the
    `slide_player:` section, and you show slides from a show step via
    the `slides:` setting for that step.
* You set the color of LEDs via a config file in the `light_player:`
    section, and you set colors from a show step via the `lights:`
    setting for that step.
* You set player and machine variables based on events in the
    `variable_player:` section (this is commonly used for scoring in
    your machine), and you set variables from a show step via the
    `variables:` setting of that step.
* etc.

## Standalone Config Player

General syntax looks like this in a standalone player:

### Normal syntax

``` yaml
example_player:
  event_which_is_posted_elsewhere:
    <depends on the player>
```

For example (show_player; short syntax):

``` yaml
show_player:
  event_which_is_posted_elsewhere:
    your_show: play
```

Another example (show_player; long syntax):

``` yaml
show_player:
  event_which_is_posted_elsewhere:
    your_show:
      action: play
      sync_ms: 1000
```

### One line syntax

This is not supported in all players. This usually performs the default
action on the element:

``` yaml
example_player:
  event_which_is_posted_elsewhere: <depends on the player>
```

An example (show_player):

``` yaml
show_player:
  event_which_is_posted_elsewhere: your_show
```

### Subscription syntax

This is not supported for all variables and all players. It will perform
the action (i.e. play a show or enable a light) when the condition
becomes true. Later it will remove/stop the action (i.e. stop the show
or disable the light) when the condition becomes false.

``` yaml
example_player:
  "{machine.test_machine_var == 23}":
      <depends on the player>
```

An example (light_player):

``` yaml
light_player:
  "{current_player.score > 1000000}":
    score_1M: white
```

See [Conditional Events](../events/overview/conditional.md) for
details about conditionals.

## Config Player in a Show

All config players also work in shows. However, you need to skip the
event which triggers the player since the action is triggered by the
show.

### Normal syntax

This supports the same syntax as above (just without the event). Also
note that instead of `example_player:` it becomes `examples:`.

``` yaml
- duration: 2s
  examples:
    <depends on the player>
```

For example (show_player; short syntax):

``` yaml
##! show: test
- duration: 2s
  shows:
    your_show: play
```

Another example (show_player; long syntax):

``` yaml
##! show: test
- duration: 2s
  shows:
    your_show:
      action: play
      sync_ms: 1000
```

### One line syntax

There is no one line syntax in shows.

There are several different config players in MPF and MPF-MC. Click on
each below for specific details of how to use them, with explanations of
how to use them in config files and in shows.
