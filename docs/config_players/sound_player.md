# Sound player


The *sound player* is a [config player](index.md)
that's used to control sounds. (This player is part of the MPF media
controller and only available if you're using MPF-MC for your media
controller.)

See [Sounds, Music & Audio](../mc/sound/index.md) and
[How to setup sound for your machine](../mc/sound/basic_setup.md) for details.

## Usage in config files

In config files, the sound player is used via the `sound_player:`
section. Event names that will trigger sound actions are nested
sub-headings and sound names are either listed as nested sub-headings
below that.

## Usage in shows

In shows, the sound player is used via the `sounds:` section of a step.

## Optional settings

Additional information may be found in the [sound_player](../config/sound_player.md)
configuration reference documentation.
