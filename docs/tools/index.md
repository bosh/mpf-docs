# Tools


There are several tools that have been created to help you build your
game in MPF.

## [MPF Monitor](monitor/index.md)

The MPF Monitor is a graphical utility you can use to interact with a
running instance of MPF. See lights change in action, click to control
switches, and lay out everything on an image of your playfield.

## ["Interactive" MC (or "iMC")](imc.md)

The interactive MC lets you create YAML configurations for slides and
widgets in realtime and see them on a display. This is great for fine
tuning and tweaking your slides.

## [Service Cli](service_cli.md)

The MPF service cli is a fast way to debug or troubleshoot your machine
during development and operation.

## [Build Production Configs](build.md)

A command to prepare production config bundles.

## [Lightshow Creator](showcreator.md)

A lightshow generator for MPF.

## [Language Server in Your IDE](language_server/index.md)

IDE support for your editor to support auto-complete for MPF configs.

## [MPF format](format.md)

Reformat your MPF config files.

## [MPF test](test.md)

Run single file tests to reproduce problems or verify behavior.

## [MPF test](../hardware/index.md)

Commands to debug, upgrade or benchmark your hardware.

## Machine Fuzzer

Fuzz your machine using afl to find crashes in MPF, your config or your
code. Currently not documented. Let us know if you want to use it.

## Hardware Debugger

The hardware debugger allows you to scan all your configured hardware
platforms. In some cases it also supports firmware updates and
configuration settings. See
[mpf hardware](../running/commands/hardware.md) for details.
