# balls_in_play


--8<-- "event.md"

The number of balls in play has just changed, and there is at least 1
ball in play.

Note that the number of balls in play is not necessarily the same as the
number of balls loose on the playfield. For example, if the player
shoots a lock and is watching a cut scene, there is still one ball in
play even though there are no balls on the playfield.
