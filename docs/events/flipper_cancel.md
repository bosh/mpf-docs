# flipper_cancel


--8<-- "event.md"

Posted when both flipper buttons are hit at the same time, useful as a
"cancel" event for shows, the bonus mode, etc.

Note that in order for this event to work, you have to add
`left_flipper` as a tag to the switch for your left flipper, and
`right_flipper` to your right flipper.

See [combo_switches:](../config/combo_switches.md) for details.
