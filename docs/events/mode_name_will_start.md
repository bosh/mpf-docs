# mode_(name)_will_start


--8<-- "event.md"

Posted when a mode is about to start. The (name) part is replaced with
the actual name of the mode, so the actual event posted is something
like *mode_attract_will_start*, *mode_base_will_start*, etc.

This is posted before the "mode_(name)_starting" event.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*
