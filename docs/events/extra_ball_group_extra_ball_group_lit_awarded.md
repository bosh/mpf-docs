# extra_ball_group_(name)\_lit_awarded


--8<-- "event.md"

Event is posted by [extra_ball_groups:](../config/extra_ball_groups.md)

This even is posted when an extra ball is lit during play. It is NOT
posted when a player's turn starts if they have a lit extra ball from
their previous turn. Therefore this event is a good event to use for
your award slides and shows when a player lights the extra ball, because
you don't want to use
[/config/extra_ball_groups](extra_ball_group_extra_ball_group_lit.md)
because that is also posted when the player's turn starts and you
don't want the award show to play again when they're starting their
turn.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*
