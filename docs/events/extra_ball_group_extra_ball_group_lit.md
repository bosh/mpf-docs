# extra_ball_group_(name)\_lit


--8<-- "event.md"

Event is posted by [extra_ball_groups:](../config/extra_ball_groups.md)

An extra ball was just lit. This is a good event to use to start your
extra ball lit mode, to turn on an extra ball light, to play the "get
that extra ball" sound, etc.

Note that this event is posted if an extra ball is lit during play and
also when a player's turn starts if they have a lit extra ball.

See also the [/config/extra_ball_groups](extra_ball_extra_ball_lit.md)
for a similar event that is only posted when an extra ball is lit during
play, and not if the player starts their turn with the extra ball lit.
