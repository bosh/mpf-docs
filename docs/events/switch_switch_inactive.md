# switch_(name)_inactive


*MPF-MC Event*

Posted on MPF-MC only (e.g. not in MPF) when the MC receives a BCP
"switch" inactive command. Useful for video modes and graphical menu
navigation. Note that this is not posted for every switch all the time,
rather, only for switches that have been configured to send events to
BCP.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*

Event is posted by [switches:](../config/switches.md)
