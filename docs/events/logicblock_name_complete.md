# logicblock_(name)\_complete


--8<-- "event.md"

Event is posted by [counters:](../config/counters.md), [accruals:](../config/accruals.md), and [sequences:](../config/sequences.md)

The logic block called (name) has just been completed.

Note that this is the default completion event for logic blocks, but
this can be changed in a logic block's "events_when_complete:"
setting, so this might not be the actual event that's posted for all
logic blocks in your machine.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*
