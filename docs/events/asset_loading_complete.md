# asset_loading_complete


--8<-- "event.md"

Posted when the asset manager has loaded all the assets in its queue.

Note that this event does *NOT* necessarily mean that all asset loading
is complete. Rather is just means that the asset manager has loaded
everything in its queue.

For example, when the MPF-MC boots, it will load the assets it is
configured to load on start. However, if the MPF MC is started but MPF
is not, then the MPF MC will load its assets and then post this
*asset_loading_complete* event when it's done. Then when MPF is started
and connects, MPF will need to load its own assets, which means the MPF
MC will post more *loading_assets* and then a final
*asset_loading_complete* event a second time for the MPF-based assets.
