Event is posted by [magnets:](../config/magnets.md)

The magnet called (name) has completed grabbing the ball. Note that the
magnet doesn't actually "know" whether it successfully grabbed a ball
or not, so this event is saying that that the process is complete rather
than confirming that it has a ball.
