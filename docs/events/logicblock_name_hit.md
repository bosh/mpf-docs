# logicblock_(name)\_hit


--8<-- "event.md"

Event is posted by [counters:](../config/counters.md), [accruals:](../config/accruals.md), and [sequences:](../config/sequences.md)

The logic block (name) was just hit.

Note that this is the default hit event for logic blocks, but this can
be changed in a logic block's "events_when_hit:" setting, so this
might not be the actual event that's posted for all logic blocks in
your machine.
