# logicblock_(name)_hit


--8<-- "event.md"

The logic block "name" was just hit.

Note that this is the default hit event for logic blocks, but this can
be changed in a logic block's "events_when_hit:" setting, so this
might not be the actual event that's posted for all logic blocks in
your machine.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*

Event is posted by [counters:](../config/counters.md)

Event is posted by [accruals:](../config/accruals.md)

Event is posted by [sequences:](../config/sequences.md)
