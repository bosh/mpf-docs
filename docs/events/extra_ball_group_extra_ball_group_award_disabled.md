# extra_ball_group_(name)\_award_disabled


--8<-- "event.md"

Event is posted by [extra_ball_groups:](../config/extra_ball_groups.md)

Posted when you have the global extra ball settings set to not enable
extra balls but where an extra ball would have been awarded. This is a
good alternative event to use to score points or whatever else you want
to give the player when extra balls are disabled.
