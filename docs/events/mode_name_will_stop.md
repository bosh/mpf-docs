# mode_(name)_will_stop


--8<-- "event.md"

Posted when a mode is about to stop. The "name" part is replaced with
the actual name of the mode, so the actual event posted is something
like *mode_attract_will_stop*, *mode_base_will_stop*, etc.

This is posted immediately before the "mode_(name)_stopping"
event.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*
