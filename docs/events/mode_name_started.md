# mode_(name)_started


--8<-- "event.md"

Posted when a mode has started. The (name) part is replaced with the
actual name of the mode, so the actual event posted is something like
*mode_attract_started*, *mode_base_started*, etc.

This is posted after the "mode_(name)_starting" event.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*
