The `mode_settings:` section of your config is a generic section that
contains settings that you might want to use in a specific mode. It's
nice because it's pretty much ignored by the general MPF config
processing, meaning you can put whatever settings you want in here for a
specific mode.

In fact, several of the built-in MPF modes make use of the
`mode_settings:` section, including:

* [End of Ball Bonus mode](bonus.md)
