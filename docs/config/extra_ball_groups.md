## Optional settings

The following sections are optional in the `extra_ball_groups:` section
of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

([Instructions for entering device control events](instructions/device_control_events.md)). Defaults to empty.

Immediately awards an extra ball.

This event first checks to make sure the limits of the max extra balls
have not been exceeded and that this group is enabled.

Note that this method will work even if this group does not have any
extra balls or extra balls lit. You can use this to directly award an
extra ball.

### award_lit_events:

List of one (or more) device control events
([Instructions for entering device control events](instructions/device_control_events.md)). Defaults to empty.

Events to award a lit extra ball. If the player does not have any lit
extra balls, this method does nothing.

### enabled:

Single value, type: `boolean` (`true`/`false`). Default: `true`

Whether this ball group is enabled.

### light_events:

List of one (or more) device control events
([Instructions for entering device control events](instructions/device_control_events.md)). Defaults to empty.

Light the extra ball for possible collection by the player. This method
checks that the group is enabled and that the max lit value has not been
exceeded. If so, this method will post the extra ball disabled events.
