The `opp_coils:` section of your config is where you configure platform
specific settings for OPP coils.

## Optional settings

The following sections are optional in the `opp_coils:` section of your
config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

### recycle_factor:

Single value, type: `integer`. Default: `None`

The recycle_factor is used in OPP to determine the cool down time of a
coil after a pulse in relation to default_pulse_ms. For instance, with
recycle_factor of 2 and a default_pulse_ms of 20ms the coil will cool
down for at least 40ms after each pulse.
