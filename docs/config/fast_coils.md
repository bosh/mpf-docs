The `fast_coils:` section of your config is where you configure platform
specific settings for coils in the FAST platform.

## Optional settings

The following sections are optional in the `fast_coils:` section of your
config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

### connection:

Single value, type: one of the following options: network, local, auto.
Default: `auto`

How is your coil connected? For WPC this might be `local` otherwise
`network`.

### recycle_ms:

Single value, type: `time string (ms)`
([Instructions for entering time strings](instructions/time_strings.md)).

The cooldown time of a coil after each pulse. Any pulse during that time
will be ignored to prevent overheating the coil.
