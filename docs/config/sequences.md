[sequences](../game_logic/logic_blocks/sequences.md).

The structure of sequence logic blocks is like this:

``` yaml
sequences:
   the_name_of_this_logic_block:
      <settings>
   some_other_logic_block:
      <settings>
   a_third_logic_block:
      <settings>
```

Note that the actual name of the logic block doesn't really matter.
Mainly they're just used in the logs.

## Required settings

The following sections are required in the `sequences:` section of your
config:

### events:

List of one (or more) events. The device will add handlers for those
events. Defaults to empty.

The events section of a sequence logic block is where you define the
events this logic block will watch for in order to make progress towards
completion.

The real power of logic blocks is that you can enter more than one event
for each step, and *only one* of the of the events of that step has to
happen for that step to be complete.

Another way to look at it is that there's an *AND THEN* between all the
steps. For the Sequence to complete, you need Step 1 *AND THEN* Step 2
*AND THEN* Step 3. But since you can enter more than one event for each
step, you could think of those like *OR*s. So you have Step 1 (event1
*OR* event2) *AND THEN* Step 2 (event3) *AND THEN* Step 3 (event4 *OR*
event5), like this:

``` yaml
##! mode: mode1
sequences:
  my_sequence:
    events:
      - event1, event2
      - event3
      - event4, event5
```

It might seem kind of confusing at first, but you can build this up
bit-by-bit and figure them out as you go along.

You can enter anything you want for your events, whether it's one of
MPF's built-in events or a made-up event that another logic block posts
when it completes. (This is how you chain multiple logic blocks together
to form complex logic.)

For example:

``` yaml
##! mode: mode1
sequences:
  logic_block_1:
    events:
      - event1
      - event2
      - event3
      - event4
      - event5
    events_when_complete: logic_block_1_done
  logic_block_2:
    events:
      - event1, event2, event3
      - event4
      - event5
    events_when_complete: logic_block_2_done
```

In the example above, there are two logic blocks. The first one just has
five steps that need to complete (in 1-2-3-4-5 exact order since we're
dealing with sequence logic blocks), and each step only has one event
that will mark is as complete.

In the second example, if event 1, 2, or 3 is posted, that will count
for step 1, and then both events 4 and 5 need to be posted for steps 2
and 3. (Again, in order, so event 1, 2, or 3 has to be posted before the
logic block will even start looking for event 4.)

So in the second one, you could get event2, event4, then event5 posted,
for example, and that will lead to *logic_block_2_done* being posted.

Note that you can have two logic blocks with the same events at the same
time, and MPF will track the state of each logic block separately.

## Optional settings

The following sections are optional in the `sequences:` section of your
config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

### console_log:

Single value, type: one of the following options: none, basic, full.
Default: `basic`

Log level for the console log for this device.

### debug:

Single value, type: `boolean` (`true`/`false`). Default: `false`

Set this to true to see additional debug output. This might impact the
performance of MPF.

### file_log:

Single value, type: one of the following options: none, basic, full.
Default: `basic`

Log level for the file log for this device.

### label:

Single value, type: `string`. Default: `%`

Name of this device in service mode.

### tags:

List of one (or more) values, each is a type: `string`. Defaults to
empty.

Currently unused.

## Optional settings

The following sections are optional in the `logic_blocks_common:`
section of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be
used).

### disable_events:

List of one (or more) device control events
([Instructions for entering device control events](instructions/device_control_events.md)).

Event(s) that will disable this logic block.

A logic block must be enabled to track hits, progress, and to post
events.

### disable_on_complete:

Single value, type: `boolean` (`true`/`false`). Default: `true`

True/False (or Yes/No) which controls whether this logic block disables
itself once it completes. This does not reset the current value.

### enable_events:

List of one (or more) device control events
([Instructions for entering device control events](instructions/device_control_events.md)).

Event(s) that will enable this logic block.

A logic block must be enabled to track hits, progress, and to post
events.

If you don't have any enable_events listed, then the logic block will
automatically be enabled when the player's ball starts.

### events_when_complete:

List of one (or more) events.

Events that will be posted when this device is completed.

### events_when_hit:

List of one (or more) events.

Events that will be posted when this device is hit or advanced.

### persist_state:

Single value, type: `boolean` (`true`/`false`). Default: `false`

Boolean setting (yes/no or true/false) which controls whether this logic
block remembers where it was from ball-to-ball. If `False`, then this
logic block will reset itself whenever a new ball starts. If `True`,
then this logic block will be saved to the player variable
*\(logic_block_name\)_state*.

Note that logic block state is reset on mode end when this is `False`
and, as normal modes stop at the end of a ball, the state is always
maintained on a per-player basis, regardless of what this setting is
configured for.

### reset_events:

List of one (or more) device control events
([Instructions for entering device control events](instructions/device_control_events.md)).

Event(s) that will reset this logic block back to its original value.
This has no effect on the enabled/disabled state of the block.

Note that there are also `reset_on_complete:` and `persist_state:`
settings which also affect how and when the logic block is reset.

You can reset a logic block regardless of whether it's enabled.

### reset_on_complete:

Single value, type: `boolean` (`true`/`false`). Default: `true`

True/False (or Yes/No) which controls whether this logic block resets
itself once it completes. This just resets the current value or
progress. It does not change the enabled or disabled state.

Note, `disable_on_complete` default is `true`, which may seem like reset
isn't working. For something like a counter that automatically starts
again change `disable_on_complete` to `false`.

### restart_events:

List of one (or more) device control events
([Instructions for entering device control events](instructions/device_control_events.md)).

List of one (or more) events which, when posted, will restart this logic
block. A restart is a reset, then an enable, combined into a single
action.

### start_enabled:

Single value, type: `boolean` (`true`/`false`).

If `true` this device will start enabled. If `false` this device will
start disabled. If you omit this the device will start enabled unless
you specify `enable_events` in which case the device will start
disabled.
