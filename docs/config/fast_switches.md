The `fast_switches:` section of your config is where you configure
platform specific details about switches when using
[fast hardware](../hardware/fast/index.md).

``` yaml
switches:
  some_switch:
    number:
    platform_settings:
      debounce_close: 2ms
      debounce_open: 4ms
```

Please make sure to read [Debouncing in Pinball Machines](../mechs/switches/debounce.md) before changing those times.

Set the switch debounce time for closing the switch.

### debounce_open:
