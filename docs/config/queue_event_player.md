!!! note

    This section can also be used in a show file in the `queue_events:`
    section of a step.

The `queue_event_player:` section of your config file is similar to the
`event_player:`, except it posts
[queue events](../events/overview/event_types.md) instead of regular events.

This section is particularly useful with the
[queue_relay_player:](queue_relay_player.md).

Here's an example:

``` yaml
queue_event_player:
  some_event:
    queue_event: my_queue
    events_when_finished: my_queue_done
```

In the example above, when the regular event *some_event* is posted, a
new queue event called *my_queue* will be posted. After all the handlers
for *my_queue* are done, the event *my_queue_done* will be posted. (This
could be immediately if none of the handlers blocked it, or it could be
awhile if one of those handlers is doing something else first.)

## Required settings

The following sections are required in the `queue_event_player:` section
of your config:

### queue_event:

Single event. The device will add an handler for this event. Defaults to
empty.

The name of the queue event that will be posted when the parent event is
posted. (required)

## Optional settings

The following sections are optional in the `queue_event_player:` section
of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

### args:

One or more sub-entries. Each in the format of `string` : `string`

A sub-configuration of key:value pairs that will be posted with the
event. This setting is optional.

### events_when_finished:

Single event. This device will be posted by the device. Defaults to
empty.

The event name that will be posted when all the handlers of this queue
event are done processing it. This setting is optional.
