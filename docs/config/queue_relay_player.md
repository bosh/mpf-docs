The queue_relay_player lets you "pause" queue event processing until
some other event is posted, at which time the original queue event
processing continues.

Here's an example:

``` yaml
queue_relay_player:
  game_ending:
    post: start_my_mode
    wait_for: my_mode_done
```

This entry will watch for the *game_ending* event to be posted.
(*game_ending* is a queue event.) When it's posted, the queue relay
player will pause the processing of the *game_ending* event and post a
new event, the *start_my_mode* in this case.

You can use that new event to do whatever you want, like start some
custom mode you want to run at game end before the machine goes back to
the attract mode.

When your mode is done, you would configure it to post *my_mode_done*
(or whatever the `wait_for:` is set to, and that will release the queue
and progress will continue. If your mode doesn't need to do anything,
it can simply post the `wait_for:` event and exit.

!!! warning

    If the `wait_for:` event is never posted, you will break your game since
    MPF will wait forever.

Note that each entry under `queue_event_player:` (the `game_ending:` in
the example above) must be for a queue event. (You can see which events
are queue events in the
[event reference](../events/index.md).) You
can also use the [queue_event_player:](queue_event_player.md) to "convert" a regular event into a queue event.

## Required settings

The following sections are required in the `queue_relay_player:` section
of your config:

### post:

Single value, type: `string`. Defaults to empty.

The name of the event to post to trigger your action once the queue
event has been posted. (required)

### wait_for:

Single value, type: `string`. Defaults to empty.

The name of the event this queue will wait for to continue. In other
words, this is the event you need to post for the queue event to
continue. (required)

## Optional settings

The following sections are optional in the `queue_relay_player:` section
of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

### args:

One or more sub-entries. Each in the format of `string` : `string`

A sub-configuration of key:value pairs that will be posted with the
event. This setting is optional.

### pass_args:

Single value, type: `boolean` (`true`/`false`). Default: `false`

If `True` pass on the arguments from the event in `wait_for` to the
event posted in `post`.
