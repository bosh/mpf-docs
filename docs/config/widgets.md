The `widgets:` section of your config is where you pre-define "named"
widgets that you can then use later in shows and the widget_player
section of a config file. See the
[Widgets](../mc/widgets/index.md) guide for
details. You can test slides and widgets interactively using
[Interactive MC (iMC)](../tools/imc.md).

Since there are many different types of widgets in MPF, it doesn't make
sense to list all the widget type and all the options here. Instead
check out the [Widgets](../mc/widgets/index.md)
documentation which has all the details, including config file reference
for different types of widgets.
