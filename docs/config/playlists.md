The `playlists:` section of your config is where you configure
non-default parameter values for any playlist assets you want to use in
your game. (This section is part of the MPF media controller and only
available if you're using MPF-MC for your media controller.)

Here is an example:

``` yaml
# ---------------------
# SOUNDS::PLAYLIST
# ---------------------
playlists:
  playlistIntro:
    shuffle: false
    repeat: false
    sounds:
      - voiceAnnouncerNewsFlash1
      - voiceAnnouncerMessage1
      - voiceAnnouncerAliensAttack1
  playlistHighScore:
    shuffle: true
    repeat: true
    crossfade_mode: override
    crossfade_time: 5s
    sounds:
      - soundHighScore001
      - soundHighScore002
      - soundHighScore003
      - soundHighScore004
# ---------------------
# PLAYLIST::PLAYER

playlist_player:
  # -------------------
  # ADDED SURPRISE VOICE DURING ATTRACT MODE
  playlistAttention:
    trackplaylist:
      playlist: playlistIntro
      action: play
  # -------------------
  # MUSIC DURING HIGH SCORE ENTRY
  high_score_enter_initials:
    trackplaylist:
      playlist: playlistHighScore
      shuffle: true
      repeat: true
      action: play
  mode_attract_started:
    trackplaylist:
      action: stop
```

## Required settings

The following sections are required in the `playlists:` section of your
config:

### sounds:

List of one (or more) values, each is a type: `string`. Defaults to
empty.


If you want to use a sound that has spaces in its name, the name of the
sound must be in quotes: :

```
playlists:
    mode_music:
        sounds:
            * song_01
            * song_02
            * "song 03" \# example of a sound with a space in its name using quotes
            * song_04
```

## Optional settings

The following sections are optional in the `playlists:` section of your
config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

### crossfade_mode:

Single value, type: one of the following options: use_track_setting,
override. Default: `use_track_setting`

The `crossfade_mode:` of a playlist determines whether the playlist uses
the track `crossfade_time` setting or the `crossfade_time` specified in
the playlist. Options for `crossfade_mode:` are:

* `use_track_settings` - Use the `crossfade_time` specified in the
    playlist track.
* `override` - Use the `crossfade_time` specified in the playlist.

### crossfade_time:

Single value, type: `time string (secs)`
([Instructions for entering time strings](instructions/time_strings.md)). Default: `0`

The number of seconds over which to crossfade between sounds in the
playlist. This value is ignored when `crossfade_mode:` is set to
`use_track_setting`.

### events_when_looping:

List of one (or more) events. Those will be posted by the device.
Defaults to empty.

A list of one or more names of events that MPF will post when this
playlist loops back to the beginning while playing. The playlist will
only loop if `repeat:` is set to `True`. Enter the list in the MPF
config list format. These events are posted exactly as they're entered.

### events_when_played:

List of one (or more) events. Those will be posted by the device.
Defaults to empty.

A list of one or more names of events that MPF will post when this
playlist is played. Enter the list in the MPF config list format. These

### events_when_sound_changed:

Defaults to empty.

A list of one or more names of events that MPF will post when a new
sound is played while the playlist is played. Enter the list in the MPF
config list format. These events are posted exactly as they're entered.

### events_when_sound_stopped:

List of one (or more) events. Those will be posted by the device.
Defaults to empty.

A list of one or more names of events that MPF will post when a playlist
sound has finished playing. Enter the list in the MPF config list
format. These events are posted exactly as they're entered.

### events_when_stopped:

List of one (or more) events. Those will be posted by the device.
Defaults to empty.

A list of one or more names of events that MPF will post when this
playlist has finished playing. Enter the list in the MPF config list
format. These events are posted exactly as they're entered.

### repeat:

Single value, type: `boolean` (`true`/`false`). Default: `false`

Flag indicating whether or not the playlist will repeat when all sounds
have been played or just stop.

### scope:

Single value, type: one of the following options: machine, player.
Default: `machine`

Whatever this playlist should be persisted per player or machine-wide.

### shuffle:
