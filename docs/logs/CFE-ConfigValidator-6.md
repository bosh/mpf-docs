# CFE-ConfigValidator-6: Device not found in section in your config

This error occurs when MPF does not find a device which is referenced by
one of your settings in your config.

## Examples

For instance, a flipper device references a switch and a coil:

``` mpf-config
switches:
  s_flipper_left:
    number:
coils:
  c_flipper_left:
    number:
flippers:
  left_flipper:
    main_coil: c_flipper_left
    activation_switch: s_flipper_left
```

You can see to which type of device a setting references in the
[config reference](../config/index.md) of your
device. For this instance, check the
[flipper config reference](../config/flippers.md) and you will find that `main_coil` references a
[coil](../config/coils.md) and
`activation_switch` references a
[switch](../config/switches.md).

## Common Pitfalls

### Typos

The most common source for this kind of error are typos. Check the name
of your referenced device with the setting. Casing matters here (i.e.
upper/lower case). Using an
[IDE with the MPF language server](../tools/language_server/index.md) can help here.

### Copy and Paste

We all do this and there is nothing wrong with copying configs from the
docs. Almost all examples in the docs are tested and should not give
this kind of error. However, sometimes we hide certain devices in the
docs (i.e. switches and coils which are referenced by an examplary
flipper device as above). This is done to improve readability but when
copying those examples you might get this error. Nevertheless, you can
click "Click to show full config" below all examples to see the full
tested example which is tested to work in the MPF version corresponding
to the docs.

### Running Config from a different MPF Version

Sometimes MPF config specifications change. Check if your MPF version
fits the config. If in doubt check the
[config reference](../config/index.md) for
your device.

### Referencing a different type of device

If you reference a different device MPF won't find it and show this
error. Check the [config reference](../config/index.md) of your device to see which device is expected or setup your
[IDE with the MPF language server](../tools/language_server/index.md).
