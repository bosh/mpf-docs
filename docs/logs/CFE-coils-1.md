# CFE-coils-1: Driver must have a number

Related Config File Sections:

* [coils:](../config/coils.md)

This error occurs when MPF loads a coil which is has an empty number or
misses a number entry. Unfortunately, hardware needs a switch number to
address your coil and it cannot continue without a number.

## Examples

### Physical Coils

This is how a coil should look:

``` mpf-config
coils:
  your_coil:
    number: 1
```

The actual number depends on your hardware platform. See the
[How to configure "number:" settings](../hardware/numbers.md) guide for details.

### Virtual Coils

Sometimes you did not wire up a coil but you know that you will need it
later. This is a problem for your physical hardware controller but you
can tell MPF to use the `virtual` hardware platform for one particular
coil:

``` mpf-config
coils:
  your_virtual_coil:
    number:
    platform: virtual
```

In this case the number can be empty.
