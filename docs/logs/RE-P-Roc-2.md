# RE-P-Roc-2 - Communication with P/P3-Roc broke down

Related Config File Sections:

* [p_roc:](../config/p_roc.md)

In your log you will probably find a line such as:

``` doscon
OSError: Error in WriteData: wrote 0 of 8 bytes
```

This error occurs when `pinproc` (the library MPF uses to talk to the
P/P3-Roc) reports an error while talking to the P/P3-Roc via USB. This
is most likely a bad cable or a power supply issue. See
[Troubleshooting P-Roc/P3-Roc](../hardware/multimorphic/troubleshooting.md)
for potential causes and solutions.
