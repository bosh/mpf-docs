# Log-SwitchController-1: Received duplicate switch state for switch

Related Config File Sections:

* [switches:](../config/switches.md)

MPF expects to get only state changes from platforms. That is part of
the platform interface contract. This warning indicates that the
contract is violated (i.e. because MPF got a switch close but the switch
has been closed before). This might indicate bugs in the platform
firmware, our platform interface or the communication in between.

MPF handles this gracefully so there is no need to worry. It will just
ignore the second hit and carry on.

There are conditions where you will see this. Our smart virtual platform
will sometimes trigger this. Those are kind of bugs. Usually harmless
but we will fix them if you report them.

Additionally, you can trigger those warnings if you use more than source
of switch states at once for the same switch. That could be any two of a
hardware platform, MPF monitor or keyboard mappings.

Lastly, the P-Roc is known for sending switches twice when using
debounced switches. This has to do with its internal state machine and
is usually harmless.
