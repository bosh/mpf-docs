# CFE-ConfigValidator-13: Cannot convert value to boolean

This error occurs when MPF expects a boolean value (i.e. `true` or
`false`) for a config setting but got a value of a different type.

## Examples

For instance, the `debug` setting for a
[switch](../config/switches.md) is a boolean:

``` mpf-config
switches:
  s_flipper_left:
    number: 1
    debug: true   # we want all the details about this switch in the logs
```

You can see which settings are boolean in the
[config reference](../config/index.md) of your
device.

## Common Pitfalls

### Widget Animations Repeat

In MPF versions before 0.53 `repeat` in widgets has been an integer
which has been converted to boolean internally. A lot of examples (and
the tutorial) contained `repeat: -1`. You need to change this to
`repeat: false` to fix this error.

### Using Quotes

If you use `debug: "false"` (with quotes around `false`) MPF will not
recognize `false` as a boolean but as a string. Remove the quotes to fix
this.
