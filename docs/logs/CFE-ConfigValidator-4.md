# CFE-ConfigValidator-4: Invalid Validator in config spec

This error occurs when MPF does not understand the config specification
for a device. Unless you created custom config specs in a mode,
(external) platform or custom device, this is certainly a bug in MPF.
Please report this in our forum in that case!
