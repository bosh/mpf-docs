# RE-P-Roc-1 - Known Firmware Bug in P/P3-Roc

Related Config File Sections:

* [p_roc:](../config/p_roc.md)

This error occurs when you try to use `pulse_power` on drivers on the
P3-Roc with firmware 2.14 or earlier and enable a rule with hold.

This can be solved by either removing `pulse_power` from the coil in
question or by upgrading the firmware. Firmware can be obtained from the
Multimorphic Member Area.

See [How to update the Firmware of the P-Roc or P3-Roc](../hardware/multimorphic/firmware_upgrade.md) for details about the upgrade process.
