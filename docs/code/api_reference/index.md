# API Reference Index

MPF's API reference is broken into several categories. All of it is presented in the way that the modules and classes are actually used in MPF.

* [Core Components](core/index.md): MPF core components.

* [Devices](devices/index.md): MPF devices, including physical devices like flippers, ball devices, switches, lights, etc. as well as logical devices like ball saves, extra balls, multiballs, etc.

* [Modes](modes/index.md): Built-in modes, such as game, attract, tilt, credits, etc.

* [Platforms](hardware_platforms/index.md): Hardware platforms interfacess for all supported hardware.

* [Config Players](config_players/index.md): Modules responsible for all config players (show_player, light_player, score_player, etc.)

* [Tests](testing_class_api/index.md): All unit test base classes for writing tests for MPF and your own game.

* [Miscellaneous Components](misc_components/index.md): Things that don't fit into other categories, including utility functions, the base classes for modes, players, timers, and other utility functions.
