??? tip "Page navigation via the keyboard: ++less++ ++greater++"

    You can navigate this site via the keyboard. There are two modes:

    General navigation, when _search_ is not focused:

    * ++f++ , ++s++ , ++slash++ : open search dialog
    * ++p++ , ++comma++ : go to previous page
    * ++n++ , ++period++ : go to next page

    While using the _search_ function:

    * ++arrow-down++ , ++arrow-up++ : select next / previous result
    * ++esc++ , ++tab++ : close search
    * ++enter++ : go to highlighted page in the results
