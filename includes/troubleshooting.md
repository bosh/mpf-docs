## Your hardware is not working at all

If your hardware is not working at all make sure that you removed the
options `-X`, `-x` and `--vpx` from your `mpf both` or `mpf game`
command line. Those options will overwrite the settings in your
`hardware` section and MPF will not even try to connect to your
hardware. If you got config errors we suggest you add `-X` to figure
things out without interfacing real hardware all the time. Just keep
that option in mind.

Another stupid thing to check: Is your hardware connected to your PC? We
know it is stupid but a loose USB connector has happened to most of us.

On Linux you might want to run the command `lsusb` which should show
both of your micro controllers connected. You should see two lines
similar to

``` console
Bus 002 Device 014: ID 0483:5740 STMicroelectronics Virtual COM Port
Bus 002 Device 015: ID 0483:5740 STMicroelectronics Virtual COM Port
```

If you are unsure about the output, run the command once with your
controllers connected and once without. If there is no difference, then
for sure the USB device is not properly connected.

## Add debugging to related devices

If you got problems with some switches also add `debug: true` to those
as it will give to more insights into the intentions of those devices.
Same will work for flippers, coils, lights, servos, steppers and more.
See
[general debugging section](../../troubleshooting/general_debugging.md) for details.

## Run MPF with verbose flag

See
[general debugging section](../../troubleshooting/general_debugging.md) for details. TLDR: run `mpf both -t -v -V`.

## Report Your Issue and Ask For Help
