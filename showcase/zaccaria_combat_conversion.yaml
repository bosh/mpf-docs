description: >
  Josiah and Steve were buying another game and on the way home
  picked up this Zaccaria Combat that had been sitting for far
  too long. The backglass was destroyed and the backbox had
  broken in half. The playfield was in fantastic shape, however.
  Josiah's band was looking for a new project, so they decided
  to take on the ambitious challenge of converting the "EM" game
  to "solid state" using FAST hardware and the Mission
  Pinball Framework (MPF). Josiah's band recorded some music for
  the game and Ryan began working on rebuilding the game logic
  and rules with MPF. Once the logic was more or less complete,
  Josiah and Steve began the process of putting the game back
  together and retrofitting the new hardware. The physical build
  took about 6 weeks once things were in motion. The game was
  taken to the 2017 NW Pinball and Arcade Show where it was
  played by many and received well. Fast forward to 2025, the
  game code has been updated to run on MPF 0.57. The game
  currently resides at the Death Save Pinball Cult clubhouse.
