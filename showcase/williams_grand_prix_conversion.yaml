  After converting Zaccaria Combat, Steve and Ryan began work to
  convert a William's Grand Prix. Ryan had picked up the game as
  his first machine and it was in poor shape. It worked ok, but
  there was some weirdness, probably due to worn out EM parts.
  The plan is to convert and retheme the game as "Grand Prix '86",
  with 80's style art and music. Progress halted in 2020 due to
  the global pandemic, but has picked back up as of Fall 2024.
